senior engineer不仅在技术能力上要强，在工程实践以及团队协作上也要表现出成熟。这种成熟主要体现在自我管理和团队管理上。

成熟工程师的必须具备的一些特点：
- Mature engineers seek out constructive criticism of their designs. 对他们的设计寻找批评性意见
- Mature engineers understand the non-technical areas of how they are perceived. 在非技术领域其他人对他们的看法，是否愿意和他们合作。
  - the degree to which other people want to work with you is a direct indication on how successful you’ll be in your career as an engineer. Be the engineer that everyone wants to work with. 愿意和你合作的人越多，那么你就越成功
  - Now this isn’t to say that you should shy away from giving (or getting) constructive criticism on the work produced by engineering (as opposed to the engineer personally), for fear of pissing someone off. There’s a difference between calling someone a moron and pointing out faults in their code or product. 不要担心会惹怒对方而不敢于说出问题
